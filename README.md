For the second task of my CodTech internship, I worked on a project titled "Automated Report Generation using Python". The objective was to develop a Python script that reads data from a file, analyzes it, and generates a professionally formatted PDF report. This project focused on automating a common business requirementâ€”generating reports based on data files without manual formatting. I used a simple .txt file as the input data source, which contained mock product sales data. The goal was to extract key metrics like total sales, average sales per product, and the best-selling item, and then present this analysis in a clean, structured PDF document using the FPDF Python library.

To start, I created a plain text file containing a list of products and their corresponding sales numbers. The Python script reads this file line by line, splits each line into product names and sales figures, and calculates basic statistics like totals, averages, and maximums. This analysis is stored in variables and prepared for insertion into a PDF. Using the FPDF library, I structured the PDF to include a title, a summary of the analysis, and a list of the raw data entries. The final output is a neatly formatted, downloadable PDF report that can be used for decision-making or shared with a team. The report includes headings, calculated values, and a simple layout that mimics what one might expect from a business sales summary.

Through this project, I learned how to work with file input/output in Python, perform basic data analysis, and use a third-party library (FPDF) to create professional-quality PDF documents programmatically. The script can easily be adapted to work with other file formats like .csv, .json, or .xlsx, making it a reusable and scalable solution. Most importantly, the task showed me how to bridge the gap between raw data and actionable insights in a presentable format. Automating the reporting process saves time, eliminates human error, and ensures consistent formatting. This task strengthened my scripting skills and introduced me to Python-based report generation, which is a valuable tool in both software and data-related roles.
